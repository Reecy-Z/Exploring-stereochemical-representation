# Exploring-stereochemical-representation
This is an implementation of models and data in paper"[Exploring stereochemical representation in chemical reactivity prediction]"

All reaction data, descriptors and training results are provided in .csv file in each data set folder. ([BHA_model_data](https://github.com/Reecy-Z/Exploring-stereochemical-representation/tree/main/BHA_model_data), [SMC_model_data](https://github.com/Reecy-Z/Exploring-stereochemical-representation/tree/main/SMC_model_data) and [ANSA_model_data](https://github.com/Reecy-Z/Exploring-stereochemical-representation/tree/main/ANSA_model_data))

The architecture and hyperparameters of neural network and XGBoost are included in .py file in each data set folder.

If you want to use FMSSD, please see [FMSSD](https://github.com/Reecy-Z/Exploring-stereochemical-representation/tree/main/FMSSD/feature).

We also provide analysis code of [corrlation analysis](https://github.com/Reecy-Z/Exploring-stereochemical-representation/blob/main/correlation.py), [PCA](https://github.com/Reecy-Z/Exploring-stereochemical-representation/blob/main/PCA.py) and [similarity analysis](https://github.com/Reecy-Z/Exploring-stereochemical-representation/blob/main/similarity.py).
